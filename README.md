Got it 👍 You’re asking for a **README.md template** suitable for an **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project** (not Node/Yarn like the Maker example). Here’s a clean version you can directly use in your GitHub repo:

---

# Oasis Web Development

A simple web development project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of front-end web design and interactivity.

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have:

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, etc.)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (for cloning the repository)
* A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional but recommended)

---

## 📥 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/OIBSIP_WebDevelopment_Task1.git
```

Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd OIBSIP_WebDevelopment_Task1
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

Since this is a static project (HTML, CSS, JS):

1. Open the project folder.
2. Locate the main file:

   ```
   index.html
   ```
3. Double-click it or right-click → **Open with Browser**.

Alternatively, you can use the **Live Server extension in VS Code** for auto-refresh while developing.

## 🛠 Project Structure

```bash
OIBSIP_WebDevelopment_Task1/
│
├── index.html        # Main HTML file  
├── style.css         # CSS file for styling  
├── script.js         # JavaScript file for interactivity  
├── assets/           # Images, icons, or other resources  
└── README.md         # Project documentation
```

## 📌 Notes

* This project is **frontend only**, no backend required.
* Works on any browser without extra setup.
* You can host it on **GitHub Pages** for free deployment.

Thank You....

Do you want me to also make you a **GitHub Pages deployment guide** so you can host your project online and just share the live link in your internship form?
